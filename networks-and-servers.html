      <h2>What Is a Network?</h2>
      <p>A network is a collection of computers, devices, and systems that are linked together to share resources and communicate.</p>
      <h3>Types of Networks:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LAN:</strong> Local Area Network (e.g., office networks)</li>
        <li><strong>WAN:</strong> Wide Area Network (e.g., the internet)</li>
        <li><strong>MAN:</strong> Metropolitan Area Network</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Networks:</strong> Wi-Fi</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Key Components:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Routers</li>
        <li>Switches</li>

      <h2>What Is a Server?</h2>
      <p>A server is a specialized computer or software system that provides data, services, or programs to other computers over a network.</p>
      <h3>Common Functionality of server networks:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>store and share your files;</li>
        <li>share a single internet connection between all your devices;</li>
        <li>allow staff to access files when out and about through a virtual private network (VPN);</li>
        <li>centralise printing, so the server manages print jobs and lets you share printers;</li>
        <li>host an intranet (a kind of private website holding important information about your business).</li>
        <li>run networked applications and software;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the past, a server was essential. However, most businesses use cloud computing services instead</p>

      <h2>Client/Server Network</h2>
      <p>A Client server network includes many clients or workstations that are connectedto at least one central server. most of the data and 
        the applications get installed on a server
      </p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you access your work email, your device connects to a mail server via the network to retrieve and send messages.</p>

      <h2>WI-Fi USB Dongle</h2>
      <p>3G routers allow to connect USB dongle to the router just like how we connect cable connection to router. User can into connect USB dongle as internet connection to the router and use the internet over Wi-Fi on multiple devices.
</p>
    <h4>The setup varies from D-Link to Net gear and Tata Photon to Reliance net connect. We are listing the general process.
</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Connect the 3G dongle in USB slot.</li>
        <li>Connect the router with LAN wire that you get with the router. Router cable output wire goes as input wire to Laptop.</li>
         <li>Open in the browser the link http://192.168.1.1/ similar to it. Check your router installation guide on more details.</li>
        <li>You can see router configuration page and specify your ISP provider (example: Tata photon)</li>
        <li>Enter required fields and set a password.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Networks and Servers Work Together</h2>
      <p>Servers rely on networks to deliver services. Networks depend on servers for core functions like authentication and data hosting.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you access your work email, your device connects to a mail server via the network to retrieve and send messages.</p>

      <h2>Secure Collaboration across the Internet</h2>
      <p>Securing servers and networks is critical with rising cyber threats.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use of VPNs</li>
        <li>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</li>
        <li>Routine updates and backups</li>
